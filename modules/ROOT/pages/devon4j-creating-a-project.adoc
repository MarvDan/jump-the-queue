== Introduction
In this chapter you will learn to create a workspace and create a project using the CLI or the GUI. When using devon, each project has its own workspace and can be edited by different instances of the IDE, e.g. eclipse.


==  Command Line Interface
* Go to your Devon-dist. folder. Open `console.bat` 

* Execute: `cd workspaces` 

* Execute: `devon workspace create -workspace MyWS` 

* If the job is finished, use CTRL+C to and answer y to the question

* Execute: `cd MyWS` 

* Execute: `devon devon4j create –p` and insert the following entries. 

** `serverpath`: hit Enter. (So it will be the current directory).

** `servername`: `myServer` (or any name you like).

** `packagename`: `com.capgemini.myServer` 

** `groupid`: `com.capgemini`  

** `version`:  1.0 

** `dbtype`: h2

* Execute: `update-all-workspaces.bat` from your devon-dist. folder.

* Execute: `cd MyServer` 

* Execute: `mvn install` (installs the Maven project).

* Execute: devon devon4j run –port 8081


[NOTE]
== ==  
There are two commands `devon` and `devcon`. Any of these two commands can be used. With the -h option you will always get help, e.g. `devon -h` or `devon workspaces -h`.

We see later, how to access these server. For now just use ctr+c to stop it from running.

==  Graphical User Interface
* Open: `console.bat`

* Go to your `workspaces` directory.

* Execute : `devcon -g`

* The GUI should open. Open `workspaces` select "create".

* Click "back".

* Open "devon4j". Select "create".

** `serverpath`: `../MyProject/Servers`

** `servername`: mp

** `packagename`: com.devonfw.application.mp

** `groupid`: com.devonfw.mp

** `version`: v4

** `dbtype`: h2

* Press: "Start"

* From you devon-dist. folder execute : `update-all-workspaces.bat`

* From your devon-dist. folder execute: `eclipse-jumpthequeue.bat`

* Eclipse instance should open.

Now you know how to create a project with devon/devcon.

You can also create new projects:
