== devonfw Introduction
image::images/devon/devonfw.png[devonfw Logo, 250]

http://www.devonfw.com/[devonfw] is a development platform aiming for standardization of processes and productivity boost, that provides an architecture blueprint for Java/JavaScript applications, alongside a set of tools to provide a fully functional _out-of-the-box_ development environment.

You don't need to click any links here. You can come back later if you like, but everything will be explained step by step later on.

==  Everything in a Zip Archive
The devonfw distributions can be obtained from the http://de-mucevolve02/files/devonfw/current/[releases site] and are packaged in a _zip_ file that includes all the needed tools, software and configurations.

==  No Need of Installation or Configuration
Having all the dependencies serf-contained in the distribution's _zip_ file, users don't need to install or configure anything. Just extracting the _zip_ content is enough to have a fully functional _devonfw_.

==  Pre-packaged Software
The list of software pre-installed with devonfw distributions is:

- _Eclipse_: pre-configured and fully functional IDE to develop Java based apps.

- _Java_: all the Java environment configured and ready to be used within the distribution.

- _Maven_: to manage project dependencies.

- _Node_: a NodeJS environment configured and ready to be used within the distribution.

- _Sencha_: devonfw also includes a installation of the _Sencha CMD_ tool.

- _SonarQube_: a code quality tool.

- _Tomcat_: a web server ready to test the deploy of our artifacts.

==  Server Solutions
For back-end solutions _devonfw_ provides the https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j[devon4j] platform as main implementation. With _devon4j_, users will find a standardized architecture blueprint for a Java applications based on _Spring_, and a set of best-of-breed technologies alongside a compendium of best practices and code conventions to build solid and reliable web applications.

With _devonfw_/_devon4j_ developers have at their disposal an archetype to generate new server projects with all _devon4j_ modules and pre-configurations ready to start to develop applications in a fully functional environment. 

==  Client Solutions
For client applications _devonfw_ includes two possible solutions, both based on _JavaScript_:

- https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng[devon4ng]: the _devonfw_ implementation based on https://angular.io/[Angular] framework.

// - https://github.com/devonfw/devon4sencha[devon4sencha]: a client solution based on the https://www.sencha.com/[Sencha] framework.

==  Custom Tools

== Devcon
For project management and other life-cycle related tasks, _devonfw_ provides also https://github.com/devonfw/devcon[Devcon], a command line and graphic user interface cross platform tool.

With _Devcon_ users can automate the creation of new projects (both server and client), build and run those and even, for server projects, deploy locally on Tomcat.

All those tasks can be done manually using _Maven_, _Tomcat_, _Sencha CMD_, _Bower_, _Gulp_, etc. but with _Devcon_ users have the possibility of managing the projects without the necessity of dealing with all those different tools.

== CobiGen

_CobiGen_ is a code generator included in the context of _devonfw_ that allows users to generate all the structure and code of the components, helping to save a lot of time consumed in repetitive tasks.

==  ip modules

As part of the goal of productivity boosting, _devonfw_ provides also to developers a set of _modules_, created from real projects requirements, that can be connected to projects saving all the work of a new implementation.

The current available modules are:

- `async`: module to manage asynchronous web calls in a _Spring_ based server app.

- `i18n`: module for internationalization.

- `integration`: implementation of https://projects.spring.io/spring-integration/[Spring integration].

- `microservices`: a set of archetypes to create a complete microservices infrastructure based on https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/[Spring Cloud Netflix].

- `reporting`: a module to create reports based on http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library[Jasper reports] library.

- `winauth active directory`: a module to authenticate users against an _Active Directory_.

- `winauth single sign on`: module that allows applications to authenticate the users by the Windows credentials.
